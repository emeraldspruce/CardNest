## 📦 Project Limitations

This project is designed with the ultimate goal of utilizing **Plaid** to fetch and store realtime 
data of all of your accounts. However, in the meantime instead of realtime data we operate off 
of CSV files which emulate your transaction history. Unfortunately, this isn't how we would 
want the product to perform but in the meantime it'll have to do.
